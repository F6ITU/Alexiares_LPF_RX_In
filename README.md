Alex RX 7th order lpf with 88-108 rejection notch

This repository contains the High Pass Filter project of the OpenHPSDR Alexiares frontend

Originaly, this filter is located on the RX, HPF board of Alexiares. 
As the size of this hpf board is limited, it has been decided to 
put this lpf and the TX/RX relay (RXpath and Pure Signal path) on a 
specific board.

The filter is a 7th order lpf with 2 notch rejection frequecies 
centered on the FM broadcast band (88 and 108 MHz). Thus, very strong
FM radio station will not be received in the 4th Nyquist zone of 
the SDR.

A "watertight" rf shielding could be placed around the board or around 
the filter itself. 

The file lpf input.PNG gives a simulation of this filter
